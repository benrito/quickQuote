  # Here the `find_or_initialize_by` method is used. It tries to find a user with the provided uid and, if found,
  # the record is returned as a result. If it is not found, a new object is created and returned.
  # This is done to avoid situations when the same user is being created multiple times.
  # We then fetch the userâ€™s name and token, save the record, and return it.
